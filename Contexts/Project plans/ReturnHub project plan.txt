- Login: JWT access(15m) + refresh cookie; refresh endpoint.
Lost-Item User: Submit Lost Report
- Form: category, description(min 20), date, location, photos(1–5), tags.
- Upload via pre-signed URLs; create report(type LOST, status PENDING).
- Edit while PENDING/REVIEWED; track status; claim flow with proof upload.
Found-Item User: Report Found Item
- Form: description, location, time, photos; optional anonymity.
- Create report(type FOUND, status PENDING); record handover.
